# As a part of requirnment gathering which king of requirnment we gather?


## Types of Requirements in the Requirement Gathering Phase

Requirement gathering is a crucial step in software development, where stakeholders define the system's expected features and behavior. The objective is to ensure that the final software meets the needs and expectations of all involved parties.

## Key Types of Requirements:

### 1. Functional Requirements
These define what the system is expected to do, outlining the core functionalities and tasks the software must perform.
- **Examples**:
  - Calculate and display the total cost of a shopping cart.
  - Enable users to create, edit, and delete profiles.
  - Integrate with third-party payment services.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements
These specify how the system should perform, focusing on quality attributes and operational constraints.
- **Examples**:
  - **Performance**: Response time and system throughput.
  - **Security**: Data protection and access control.
  - **Usability**: Ease of use and accessibility.
  - **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and error recovery.
  - **Maintainability**: Modifiability and ease of testing.

### 3. User Interface (UI) Requirements
These describe how the system should look and feel, defining the visual and interactive aspects of the software.
- **Examples**:
  - Consistent branding and design across the interface.
  - Intuitive navigation and user workflows.
  - Clear and actionable error messages.

### 4. Data Requirements
These define the data the system needs to store, process, and manage, including its structure and relationships.
- **Examples**:
  - Customer details (name, address, contact information).
  - Product information (description, price, stock level).
  - Order records (order date, items, total amount).

### 5. Business Rules
These define how the system operates within the business environment, including rules and regulations the software must follow.
- **Examples**:
  - Discounts applied for bulk purchases.
  - Inventory management policies.
  - Compliance with industry standards and regulations.

### 6. Constraints
These specify external limitations or restrictions affecting the system's design, development, and operation.
- **Examples**:
  - Budgetary restrictions.
  - Technology limitations.
  - Compliance with regulatory requirements.

By carefully gathering and analyzing these diverse requirements, development teams can build a product that aligns with the needs of users, stakeholders, and business goals.

## The next phase after requirement gathering in software development is requirement analysis.

### Requirement analysis involves:

- Validating and prioritizing requirements: Ensuring that all gathered requirements are valid, feasible, and aligned with project goals.
- Identifying dependencies and conflicts: Determining how different requirements interact and potentially conflict with each other.
- Defining acceptance criteria: Establishing clear and measurable criteria for determining if a requirement has been successfully implemented.
- Creating a requirements traceability matrix: Linking requirements to design artifacts, test cases, and other project deliverables to ensure that all requirements are addressed.

### Key activities in requirement analysis include:

- Use case analysis: Creating diagrams and descriptions that illustrate how users interact with the system to achieve their goals.
- Data flow diagrams: Modeling the flow of data through the system to understand how information is processed.
- Entity-relationship diagrams: Representing the relationships between data entities within the system.
- Non-functional requirements analysis: Evaluating factors such as performance, security, usability, and maintainability.
- Once requirement analysis is complete, the development team can move on to the design phase, where they will create detailed plans for implementing the identified requirements.

# Finding Outcode: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86db637b-ec1e-4493-9019-df3ffa96c0d3)

## Outcode POC

- Conduct a feasibility study for the POC. (experiments). 
- Assess whether it's achievable and identify potential advantages.
- If feasible, quantify the benefits numerically. If not, it may seem biased.
- Focus on understanding the problem rather than falling in love with a specific solution. Identify challenges and explore potential advantages, then dive deeper into the core problem. Avoid parallel exploration; prioritize issues to help developers focus on finding the right solutions.
- Explore various solutions, as multiple approaches may exist to address the same problem.
- Ensure that the words and sentences used in the Outcode diagram convey positive meanings.
- spent more time in opportunities.
- discuss a feature not a full products.


## Modern product discovery Principles. 
### Collaborative Descision making.

- Avoid injecting a waterfall approach into the design.

### Externalize (Visialize) your Thinking

- Embrace notes; they help visualize thinking.

### Be outcome focused

- Be prepared to negotiate during the Outcode process  for achiving outcode. don't stand for solution, but stand for outcome.
- If all stakeholders agree on the Outcode, identifying opportunities and solutions becomes much easier, as everyone is aligned.

### Discover Opportunities.

- There are many ways to find opportunities—customers can raise tickets, or you can review competitor feedback.
- List down all possibilities.

### Compare and contrast decisions

- When making important decisions, comparing solutions is crucial.
- pick one approach and solution based on experiments.

### Surface and test Assumptions.

- Consider assumptions across four dimensions: Valuable, Reliable, Feasible, and Viable.
- Test the assumptions by validating whether the solution addresses the desired outcomes.

## How to identify great product team.

- Understand that a product roadmap is different from a feature list.

## Product Matrics.

- Ask why product metrics are important and why they might be missing.
- Without product metrics, it's difficult to measure if the outcomes are being achieved.
- Since 2010, the Silicon Valley success rate has been low—why have 8 out of 10 products failed?
- Product metrics reveal the reality of a product’s performance and are essential for shaping the product roadmap.

### Best practices for product metrics: GSM frameworks.

- The problem statement is the foundation of the goal.
- If 10% of customers start using the product within a week, that’s the goal—then ask, how do we achieve it?
- Product goals and business goals are different.
  
### Best practices for product metrics: HEART frameworks.

- Most of person taking about happenes but not taliking about retantion. 

### Combine the GSM and HEART

#### find source of data
- anaylitivs tools, google anaylitics, cleaver tap,
- logs
- Application Database. 
- look failer single as wall, it is more powerfull then success singles.
